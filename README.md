On 5-5-2024, I joined Orange Coding Academy for a 6-month coding bootcamp to become a Full-stack Web Developer. On this index page, you can see all my tasks, projects, and other activities I have completed during my time at Orange Coding Academy, along with other web page design challenges provided by Frontend Mentor. Feel free to look around and see what I have made so far. :)
