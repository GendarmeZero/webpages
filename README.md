Hi there !!
=======
On 5-5-2024, I joined Orange Coding Academy for a 6-month coding bootcamp to become a Full-stack Web Developer,so i made this repo with an index page to link every task project I do during the bootcamp.

On the index page, you can see all my tasks, projects, and other activities I have completed during my time at Orange Coding Academy, along with other web page design challenges provided by Frontend Mentor.

Feel free to look around and see what I have made so far. :)
