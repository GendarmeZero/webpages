    <article id="article01">
      On 5-5-2024, I joined Orange Coding Academy for a 6-month coding bootcamp to become a Full-stack Web Developer,so i made this index page to link every task  project I do during the bootcamp.
      <br>
      On this index page, you can see all my tasks, projects, and other activities I have completed during my time at
      Orange Coding Academy, along with other web page design challenges provided by Frontend Mentor.
      <br>
      Feel free to look around and see what I have made so far. :)
